# FNF---Supergames-Edition
According to the license of Friday Night Funkin', this is the open source code for the recompiled and modified version of Friday Night Funkin'.

Thank you to the creators of Friday Night Funkin'!

Of course, this version follows the same license that the creators of Friday Night Funkin' have established and is open source. A copy of it can be found here:

The modifications that had to be done are as follow:
1. Had to remove the warning before the main menu, that stated that you are not playing the latest version.
2. Had to remove the debug menu that appeared when you are playing Week 6.
3. Removed some of the options from the Main Menu, because the game crashed if you selected them (like the Options menu). Of course, we have kept the Donate button that links to the original creators of Friday Night Funkin'
4. Removed the FPS counter.
